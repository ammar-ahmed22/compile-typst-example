= Quadratics
Quadratics are polynomials of degree 2. They are also known as parabolas. 

== Roots
To find the roots of quadratic, the quadratic equation can be used:
$
  x = (-b plus.minus sqrt(b^2 - 4 a c)) / (2 a)
$

where, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the constants of the function, $f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c$.
